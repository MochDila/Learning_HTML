    <p>A <i>potager</i> is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen
        garden. Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted
        with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal to make
        the function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        <h2>What to Plant</h2>
        <p>Plants are chosen as much for their function as for their color and form.
            Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide
            food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance.
            Potagers can disguise their function of providing for a home in a wide
            array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the
            formality of a knot garden.</p>
